# CVE-2021-1056

CVE-2021-1056 proof of concept for GPU Docker container



This repository demonstrates the vulnerability on GPU containers created by [`nvidia-container-runtime`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime).

## How it works

By executing a specially `mknod` command an attacker in a GPU container(container created by `nvidia-container-runtime`) is able to get access  to all GPU devices on the host. 

It also works on GPU pod created by `k8s-device-plugin` on kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisite

* Docker 19.03
* `nvidia-container-toolkit`



## PoC

* start a container with only 1 GPU card

```bash
docker run --gpus 1 -it tensorflow/tensorflow:1.13.2-gpu bash
```
