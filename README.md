# CVE-2021-1056

CVE-2021-1056 proof of concept for GPU Docker container



This repository demonstrates the vulnerability on GPU containers created by [`nvidia-container-runtime`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime).

## How it works

By creating specific character device files an attacker in a GPU container(container created by `nvidia-container-runtime`) is able to get access  to all GPU devices on the host. 

It also works on GPU pod created by `k8s-device-plugin` on kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisite

* Docker 19.03
* `nvidia-container-toolkit`



## QuickStart
